# Pharmacy Medicine Tracker Application in Java
This application helps local pharmacies manage and track medicines efficiently. It handles two types: Over-the-Counter (OTC) and Prescription Medicines. Features include inventory management, categorization, search, and compliance tracking. It ensures smooth operations, regulatory adherence, and better customer service. 

This project is an object-oriented application designed to help local pharmacies efficiently manage their medicine inventory and operations. The system tracks two types of medicines:  

1. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medicines: Medications available without a prescription, such as pain relievers and supplements.  
2. Prescription Medicines: Medications requiring a valid prescription from a healthcare professional.
